# Nihongo

Hello!

This script was written in response to the tedious clicking I had to do when it came to organizing my Japanese lesson files. To print these original PDFs, they also had to be converted into TIFF files, since the printing would not recognize Japanese characters in PDF format, only as still images.

This program does the following:
From any new downloads within the download file that are either 
		Lessons:   *_B*
	or 	Particles: PRT
	
	Convert them from PDF to TIFF
	Relocate the TIFFs into appropriate folders.
